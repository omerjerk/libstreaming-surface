# libstreaming-surface

This is a modified version of [libstreaming](https://github.com/fyhertz/libstreaming) to take input directly from a Surface and stream the video of whatever is drawn on this Surface to network via RTSP protocol.

This rendering inside VLC has some glitches, hence I didn't complete the project. However, it does work and someone can take the work from here.

I can be reached at my email regarding any help with this project.
